\chapter{Literature Review}

\section{Introduction to the Field}
[This section should provide an overview of the research field and establish the context for your work. Include key concepts and definitions.]

\section{Historical Development}
The field of [your research area] has evolved significantly over the past several decades. Early work by \textcite{troitskii1969electromechanical} established the fundamental principles that continue to influence current research directions. Subsequent studies by \textcite{conrad2000electroplasticity} expanded our understanding of the underlying mechanisms.

\section{Current State of Knowledge}
Recent advances in [your field] have been driven by several key developments:

\subsection{Theoretical Foundations}
The theoretical framework for understanding [your topic] was established through the work of \textcite{kim2020elucidating}, who provided a comprehensive model that explains the fundamental mechanisms involved.

\subsection{Experimental Methods}
Experimental approaches have evolved significantly, with \textcite{xu2021enhanced} introducing novel techniques that have improved our ability to measure and characterize the phenomena under investigation.

\section{Key Research Areas}
Several important areas of research have emerged in recent years:

\subsection{Area 1: [Specific Research Area]}
[Description of the first research area with relevant citations and examples.]

\subsection{Area 2: [Another Research Area]}
[Description of the second research area with relevant citations and examples.]

\section{Research Gaps and Opportunities}
Despite significant progress, several important gaps remain in our understanding:

\begin{enumerate}
\item [Gap 1: Describe what is not yet understood or investigated]
\item [Gap 2: Another area that needs further research]
\item [Gap 3: Additional research opportunities]
\end{enumerate}

\section{Example Figures}
This section demonstrates how to include figures in your literature review. Figure \ref{fig:literature_overview} provides an overview of the research landscape, while Figure \ref{fig:research_trends} shows current trends in the field.
